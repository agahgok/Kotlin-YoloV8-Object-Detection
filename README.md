# Kotlin-Based Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8 and TensorFlow Lite

This project is a cutting-edge real-time object detection application that combines the power of YOLOv8 and TensorFlow Lite for seamless performance on mobile devices. Built with Kotlin, the app leverages modern Android development principles to deliver a robust, user-friendly experience.

## Key Features:
### 1. Real-Time Object Detection
The app uses YOLOv8, one of the most advanced deep learning models for object detection, to identify and classify objects in real time. Whether it's detecting everyday items or custom objects, the app offers high accuracy and speed.

### 2. GPU/CPU Processing Toggle
With a simple button in the interface, users can switch between GPU and CPU processing. This feature allows users to optimize performance based on their device's hardware capabilities or power consumption requirements.

### 3. Powered by TensorFlow Lite
The integration of TensorFlow Lite ensures that the app runs efficiently on mobile devices, leveraging optimized model inference for real-time applications.

### 4. Modern and Intuitive Interface
The application's design prioritizes simplicity and functionality, with a clean interface that makes it easy for users to view detections and interact with the settings.

### 5. Customizable for Various Use Cases
The app can be easily adapted to work with custom-trained YOLOv8 models, making it suitable for diverse use cases such as inventory management, object counting, or security monitoring.

## How It Works:

Model Integration: The YOLOv8 model is converted to TensorFlow Lite format for optimized deployment.
Real-Time Video Processing: The app captures frames from the device camera and runs object detection on each frame.
Performance Optimization: Users can toggle between GPU and CPU processing depending on their device capabilities.

## Example Use Cases:

Education: Teach students about object detection technology.
Retail: Monitor shelves for inventory management.
Personal Projects: Explore machine learning applications in daily life.

## Getting Started:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Build and run the app on an Android device with TensorFlow Lite compatibility.
Toggle GPU usage via the button for optimal performance.
This project demonstrates the powerful combination of Kotlin, YOLOv8, and TensorFlow Lite, providing a framework for mobile developers interested in building real-time machine learning applications. Feel free to fork the project, experiment with new models, or contribute to its development!
